## QSizePolicy

width, height, horizontalpolicy, verticalpolicy

QSizePolicy.Fixed
The QWidget.sizeHint() is the only acceptable alternative, so the widget can never grow or shrink (e.g. the vertical direction of a push button).
QSizePolicy.Minimum
The sizeHint() is minimal, and sufficient.
The widget can be expanded, but there is no advantage to it being larger (e.g. the horizontal direction of a push button).
It cannot be smaller than the size provided by sizeHint().
QSizePolicy.Maximum
The sizeHint() is a maximum.
The widget can be shrunk any amount without detriment if other widgets need the space (e.g. a separator line).
It cannot be larger than the size provided by sizeHint() .
QSizePolicy.Preferred
The sizeHint() is best, but the widget can be shrunk and still be useful.
The widget can be expanded, but there is no advantage to it being larger than sizeHint() (the default PySide.QtGui.QWidget policy).
QSizePolicy.Expanding
The sizeHint() is a sensible size, but the widget can be shrunk and still be useful.
The widget can make use of extra space, so it should get as much space as possible (e.g. the horizontal direction of a horizontal slider).
QSizePolicy.MinimumExpanding
The sizeHint() is minimal, and sufficient.
The widget can make use of extra space, so it should get as much space as possible (e.g. the horizontal direction of a horizontal slider).
QSizePolicy.Ignored
The sizeHint() is ignored.
The widget will get as much space as possible.
